  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Evaluate custom backtesting frameworks vs. established libraries
    - üîç [2025-04-08 00:16] Searched: "custom python backtesting framework vs established libraries comparison"
      - Result 1: Martin Mayer-Krebs - https://mayerkrebs.com/should-you-build-your-own-backtester/ - [Accessed: Yes] - [Page Examined: 2025-04-08 00:16] - [Stored as: resource4.md]
    - ‚úÖ Completed: [2025-04-08 00:18]
    - üìä Summary: 1 search conducted, 1 page examined, 1 resource stored
    - Found that custom frameworks offer deeper understanding and flexibility but at cost of development time and reliability
    - Established libraries provide community support, extensive features, bug reduction, and faster development
    - Custom frameworks are justified mainly for specific requirements, educational purposes, or integration with proprietary systems
    - Sources: [Custom vs. Established Backtesting Frameworks](../resources/resource4.md)
  - [x] Subtask 1.5: Compare event-driven vs. vectorized backtesting approaches

    - üìä Summary: 2 searches conducted, 2 pages examined, 1 resource created
    - Found event-driven approach offers higher realism but slower performance
    - Vectorized approach provides superior speed (5-75x faster) but sacrifices realism and flexibility
    - Performance gap increases with universe size (minimal for small universes, significant for 1000+ securities)
    - Sources: [Event-Driven vs. Vectorized Approaches Comparison](../resources/resource5.md)

- [x] Task 1: Research Python Backtesting Libraries
  - ‚úÖ Completed: [2025-04-08 00:21]
  - üìä Summary: All subtasks completed, 7 searches conducted, 7 pages examined, 5 resources stored
  - Key findings:
    - Backtrader is a feature-rich, multi-asset capable, event-driven framework with strong community
    - Zipline offers powerful Pipeline API but limited multi-asset support and slower performance
    - PyAlgoTrade is simple but now deprecated
    - Custom frameworks offer flexibility but require significant development resources
    - Event-driven approaches provide realism while vectorized approaches offer superior performance
    - Selection depends on strategy complexity, universe size, and performance requirements
