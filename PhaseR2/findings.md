### Custom vs. Established Backtesting Frameworks

1. **Advantages of Custom Frameworks**
   - **Understanding Limitations**: Forces active trade-offs between simplicity and reality
   - **Skill Development**: Enhances programming and algorithmic trading knowledge
   - **Custom Assumptions**: Allows introduction of tailor-made market assumptions
   - **Workflow Integration**: Can be designed to fit seamlessly with existing systems

2. **Disadvantages of Custom Frameworks**
   - **Development Cost**: High opportunity cost and resource requirements
   - **No Community Support**: Lack of forums, documentation, and shared problem-solving
   - **Feature Development Burden**: Requires implementation of all features from scratch
   - **Increased Bug Risk**: Less reliable than community-tested frameworks

3. **When to Choose Custom Frameworks**
   - Specific requirements not available in established libraries
   - Educational purposes to understand backtesting mechanics
   - Integration with proprietary systems with unique workflows
   - Need for highly specialized simulation features

### Event-Driven vs. Vectorized Backtesting

1. **Event-Driven Approach**
   - **Definition**: Processes market data sequentially as "events" in chronological order
   - **Advantages**:
     - Higher realism with accurate market simulation
     - Greater flexibility for complex strategies
     - Detailed order execution modeling
     - Easier transition to live trading
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Significantly slower performance
     - Higher development complexity
     - More resource-intensive for large universes

2. **Vectorized Approach**
   - **Definition**: Applies trading logic to arrays of historical data all at once
   - **Advantages**:
     - 5-75x faster performance (gap increases with universe size)
     - Easier implementation and maintenance
     - Superior optimization capabilities
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Limited realism in simulation
     - Difficulty implementing complex features (trailing stops, etc.)
     - Less suitable for path-dependent strategies

3. **Performance Factors**
   - **Universe Size**: Critical factor - performance gap minimal for small universes, substantial for 1000+ securities
   - **Hardware**: Modern processors and optimized numerical libraries improve performance for both approaches
   - **Implementation Efficiency**: Vectorized approaches benefit from NumPy/Pandas optimization

4. **Selection Criteria**
   - **Strategy Complexity**: Simple → Vectorized, Complex → Event-driven
   - **Performance Requirements**: Rapid iteration → Vectorized, Realistic simulation → Event-driven
   - **Universe Size**: Large universe → Vectorized, Small universe → Either approach
   - **Development Resources**: Limited time → Vectorized, Production-ready → Event-driven

## Summary of Key Findings

1. **Library Selection**
   - No single "best" library - selection depends on specific requirements
   - Backtrader offers strong all-around capabilities for complex strategies
   - VectorBT provides superior performance for large-scale testing
   - Consider the trade-off between realism (event-driven) and speed (vectorized)

2. **Framework Design Considerations**
   - Event-driven frameworks are more suitable for realistic simulation and complex execution logic
   - Vectorized frameworks excel at parameter optimization and rapid prototyping
   - Custom frameworks are justified mainly for specialized requirements or educational purposes
   - Integration with production systems should be a consideration in framework selection
