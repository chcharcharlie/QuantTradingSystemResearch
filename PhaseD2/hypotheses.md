# Hypotheses (PhaseD2)

Based on our discussions and previous research findings, we've formulated the following hypotheses to guide our upcoming research:

## Backtesting Framework Hypotheses

1. Python-based backtesting libraries (such as Backtrader or PyAlgoTrade) will provide sufficient flexibility and performance for our multi-indicator strategy implementation.

2. Event-driven backtesting approaches will provide more realistic simulation results than vectorized approaches for our specific strategy needs.

3. Walk-forward optimization techniques will significantly reduce overfitting risks compared to traditional optimization methods.

4. Including transaction costs and slippage models will materially impact backtest results, especially for higher-frequency strategies.

5. Different market regimes (trending vs. ranging) will significantly impact strategy performance metrics.

## Performance Metrics Hypotheses

1. Risk-adjusted metrics (beyond simple returns) will provide more valuable insight for strategy evaluation than absolute return metrics.

2. Drawdown characteristics (maximum drawdown, drawdown duration, recovery time) will be more informative for risk assessment than traditional volatility measures.

3. A combination of at least 5-7 different metrics will be necessary to comprehensively evaluate strategy performance.

4. The Calmar Ratio will be more relevant than the Sharpe Ratio for evaluating strategy performance in volatile market conditions.

5. Signal confidence weighting will improve overall strategy performance metrics compared to binary signal approaches.

## Implementation Hypotheses

1. A modular system architecture with separate components for data collection, signal generation, backtesting, and notification will provide the most flexibility.

2. SQLite will be sufficient for data storage needs during development, with potential migration to a more robust database for production.

3. Implementing a JSON-based configuration system will allow for easier strategy parameter adjustment without code changes.

4. Telegram integration will provide sufficient notification capabilities without requiring complex infrastructure.

5. A unified interface for both cryptocurrency and stock data sources will simplify strategy implementation across different asset classes.
