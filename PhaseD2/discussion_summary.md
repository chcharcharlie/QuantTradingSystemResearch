# Discussion Summary (PhaseD2)

## Research Review

We discussed the findings from PhaseR1, which covered:
- Quantitative trading strategies suitable for daily/weekly trading
- Data sources and APIs for stocks and cryptocurrencies
- Signal generation systems and position sizing approaches

## User Feedback

The user inquired about semantic data sources and their potential value for the trading system. We explored:
- The availability of semantic data through existing tools
- Testing the financial-datasets API capabilities
- Finding limitations in the current API (works for stocks but limited for crypto)

## Priorities for Next Phase

After discussion, we identified two critical areas requiring further research:
1. Backtesting frameworks and methodologies
2. Performance metrics and evaluation criteria

These were prioritized as necessary foundations before finalizing the system architecture.

## Implementation Considerations

Key implementation points discussed:
- The initial system should use a multi-indicator approach with EMA/SMA crossovers and RSI confirmation
- Start with the available financial-datasets API for stocks, supplement with Alpha Vantage for crypto
- Implement confidence-weighted signals with position sizing
- Use Telegram for notifications
- Create detailed system architecture after completing the backtesting research
