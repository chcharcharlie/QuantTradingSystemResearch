1. PhaseD1: Initial discussion to understand requirements and objectives
2. PhaseR1: First research phase based on identified requirements
3. PhaseD2: Follow-up discussion to refine direction based on research findings
4. PhaseR2: Further research based on refined requirements
5. Additional phases as needed
