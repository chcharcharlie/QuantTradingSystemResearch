## Signal Generation and Risk Management

### Effective Technical Indicators for Volatile Markets

1. **Volatility-Based Indicators**

3. **Signal Confidence Integration**
   - Scale position size based on signal confidence level
   - Use tiered approach for different confidence levels
   - Adjust risk parameters based on signal strength
