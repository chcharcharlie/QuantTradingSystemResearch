# QuantTradingSystem Status Report

## Current Phase

PhaseR2 (Research Phase 2) - In progress

## Project Status

Project initiated on 2025-04-06. Completed initial discussion phase, first research phase, and second discussion phase. Currently in Research Phase 2 focusing on backtesting frameworks and performance metrics.

## Recently Completed Activities

- Completed Task 1 of Research Phase 2: Python backtesting libraries evaluation
- Researched features, advantages, and limitations of major Python backtesting libraries
- Compared event-driven vs. vectorized backtesting approaches
- Evaluated custom vs. established backtesting frameworks
- Created comprehensive findings document on backtesting libraries

## Current In-Progress Activities

- Beginning Task 2 of Research Phase 2: Backtesting Methodologies
- Preparing to research methods to prevent overfitting in backtests
- Planning investigation of walk-forward optimization techniques

## Interesting Insights

- Event-driven backtesting provides higher realism but vectorized approaches offer 5-75x faster performance
- Performance gap between approaches increases dramatically with universe size
- Backtrader offers the best balance between flexibility and usability for complex multi-asset strategies
- Custom backtesting frameworks are rarely justified unless for specialized requirements or educational purposes
- Performance considerations should include universe size, hardware, and implementation efficiency

## Active Blockers and Challenges

- Need to identify the most suitable methods to prevent overfitting in backtests
- Determining appropriate techniques for testing strategies across different market regimes
- Finding optimal approaches for transaction cost modeling in backtests

## Immediate Next Actions

- Begin research on methods to prevent overfitting in backtests
- Investigate walk-forward optimization techniques
- Explore approaches for handling transaction costs and slippage

## Open Questions

- Which methods are most effective for preventing overfitting while maintaining strategy performance?
- How can we effectively validate strategy robustness across different market regimes?
- What is the optimal approach for modeling transaction costs in backtests?
- How can Monte Carlo simulations be integrated with backtesting for robustness testing?

## Recent Key Findings

- Backtrader is a feature-rich, multi-asset capable, event-driven framework with strong community support
- Zipline offers powerful Pipeline API but limited multi-asset support and slower performance
- Event-driven approaches provide realism while vectorized approaches offer superior performance
- Selection of backtesting approach depends on strategy complexity, universe size, and performance requirements
- Custom frameworks offer flexibility but require significant development resources and lack community support
