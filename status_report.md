# QuantTradingSystem Status Report

## Current Phase

PhaseR2 (Research Phase 2) - In progress

## Project Status

Project initiated on 2025-04-06. Completed initial discussion phase, first research phase, and second discussion phase. Currently in Research Phase 2 focusing on backtesting frameworks and performance metrics.

## Recently Completed Activities

- Completed Task 1 of Research Phase 2: Python backtesting libraries evaluation
- Researched features, advantages, and limitations of major Python backtesting libraries
- Compared event-driven vs. vectorized backtesting approaches
- Evaluated custom vs. established backtesting frameworks
- Created comprehensive findings document on backtesting libraries

## Current In-Progress Activities

- Beginning Task 2 of Research Phase 2: Backtesting Methodologies
- Preparing to research methods to prevent overfitting in backtests
- Planning investigation of walk-forward optimization techniques

## Interesting Insights

- Event-driven backtesting provides higher realism but vectorized approaches offer 5-75x faster performance
- Performance gap between approaches increases dramatically with universe size
- Backtrader offers the best balance between flexibility and usability for complex multi-asset strategies
- Custom backtesting frameworks are rarely justified unless for specialized requirements or educational purposes
- Performance considerations should include universe size, hardware, and implementation efficiency

## Active Blockers and Challenges

- Need to identify the most suitable backtesting methodology to prevent overfitting
- Determining appropriate balance between realism and performance for our strategy requirements
- Identifying the best approaches for testing across different market regimes

## Immediate Next Actions

- Research methods to prevent overfitting in backtests (Task 2, Subtask 2.1)
- Investigate walk-forward optimization techniques (Task 2, Subtask 2.2)
- Evaluate approaches for handling transaction costs and slippage in backtests

## Open Questions

- Which validation methods are most effective for preventing overfitting in our specific strategy context?
- How should walk-forward optimization be implemented to balance realism with performance?
- What technique for handling transaction costs and slippage provides the best balance of realism and simplicity?
- How should backtesting methodologies adapt to different market regimes?

## Recent Key Findings

- Backtrader is a feature-rich, multi-asset capable, event-driven framework with strong community support
- Zipline offers powerful Pipeline API but has limited multi-asset support and slower performance
- Vectorized approaches (like VectorBT) are 5-75x faster than event-driven approaches for large security universes
- Event-driven approaches provide more realistic simulation and easier transition to live trading
- Selection of backtesting framework depends on strategy complexity, universe size, and performance requirements
