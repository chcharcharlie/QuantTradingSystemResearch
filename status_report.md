# QuantTradingSystem Status Report

## Current Phase

PhaseR2 (Research Phase 2) - In progress

## Project Status

Project initiated on 2025-04-06. Completed initial discussion phase, first research phase, and second discussion phase. Currently in Research Phase 2 focusing on backtesting frameworks and performance metrics.

## Recently Completed Activities

- Completed Task 1 of Research Phase 2: Python backtesting libraries evaluation
- Researched features, advantages, and limitations of major Python backtesting libraries
- Compared event-driven vs. vectorized backtesting approaches
- Evaluated custom vs. established backtesting frameworks
- Created comprehensive findings document on backtesting libraries

## Current In-Progress Activities

- Beginning Task 2 of Research Phase 2: Backtesting Methodologies
- Preparing to research methods to prevent overfitting in backtests
- Planning investigation of walk-forward optimization techniques

## Interesting Insights

- Event-driven backtesting provides higher realism but vectorized approaches offer 5-75x faster performance
- Performance gap between approaches increases dramatically with universe size
- Backtrader offers the best balance between flexibility and usability for complex multi-asset strategies
- Custom backtesting frameworks are rarely justified unless for specialized requirements or educational purposes
- Performance considerations should include universe size, hardware, and implementation efficiency

## Active Blockers and Challenges

- Need to identify the most suitable backtesting methodology for our specific strategy needs
- Determining appropriate balance between backtesting speed and realism
- Establishing which overfitting prevention techniques are most effective

## Immediate Next Actions

- Begin research on methods to prevent overfitting in backtests (Subtask 2.1)
- Investigate walk-forward optimization techniques (Subtask 2.2)
- Research approaches for handling transaction costs and slippage in backtests (Subtask 2.3)

## Open Questions

- What is the most effective approach to prevent overfitting while maintaining strategy performance?
- How should backtesting be implemented across different market regimes to ensure robust strategies?
- What combination of performance metrics provides the most comprehensive view of strategy effectiveness?
- Which backtesting library would best suit our multi-indicator approach?

## Recent Key Findings

- Backtrader provides superior multi-asset support and optimization tools but with slower performance
- Zipline offers powerful Pipeline API for factor models but limited multi-asset capabilities
- PyAlgoTrade is now deprecated despite its simplicity and documentation
- VectorBT delivers exceptional performance but at the cost of flexibility and a steeper learning curve
- Event-driven frameworks more closely replicate real trading conditions but at significant performance cost
- Selection of backtesting approach should consider strategy complexity, universe size, and performance requirements
