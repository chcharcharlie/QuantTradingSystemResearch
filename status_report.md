# QuantTradingSystem Status Report

## Current Phase

Starting PhaseR2 (Research Phase 2)

## Project Status

Project initiated on 2025-04-06. Completed initial discussion phase, first research phase, and second discussion phase. Now beginning Research Phase 2 focusing on backtesting frameworks and performance metrics.

## Recently Completed Activities

- Completed PhaseD2 discussion about research findings and next steps
- Established action items for PhaseR2
- Formed hypotheses to test in the next research phase
- Set up research plan for PhaseR2 with detailed tasks

## Current In-Progress Activities

- Beginning Research Phase 2
- Starting investigation of Python backtesting libraries
- Preparing to research backtesting methodologies and performance metrics

## Interesting Insights

- Multi-indicator approach using EMA/SMA crossovers with RSI confirmation provides balanced signal reliability
- Cryptocurrencies historically work better with trend-following than mean-reversion strategies
- Position sizing can be dynamically adjusted based on signal confidence levels
- Alpha Vantage API provides a good starting point with free tier for development

## Active Blockers and Challenges

- Need to identify the most suitable backtesting framework for our strategy
- Determining appropriate performance metrics for strategy evaluation
- Balancing backtesting accuracy against implementation complexity

## Immediate Next Actions

- Begin Research Phase 2 tasks
- Evaluate Python backtesting libraries (Backtrader, PyAlgoTrade, Zipline)
- Research methods to prevent overfitting in backtests

## Open Questions

- Which backtesting library would best suit our multi-indicator approach?
- What combination of performance metrics will provide the most comprehensive view of strategy effectiveness?
- How can we effectively simulate different market regimes in backtests?
- What's the best approach to handle transaction costs and slippage in backtests?

## Recent Key Findings

- Most effective strategies for daily/weekly trading combine trend and momentum indicators
- Alpha Vantage and Financial Modeling Prep are strong candidates for data APIs
- Fixed Fractional position sizing with volatility adjustment provides good risk management
- Multi-indicator approach significantly reduces false signals
- Technical indicators should be adapted to market volatility conditions
- Integration with Telegram provides efficient notification delivery
