# Hypotheses (PhaseD1)

## Key Questions to Investigate

1. What quantitative trading strategies are most suitable for:
   - Weekly/daily trading frequency
   - Stocks and cryptocurrency markets
   - Low-maintenance signal generation
   - Volatile market conditions

2. How do different technical indicators perform across stock and crypto markets in terms of:
   - Signal quality
   - False positive rates
   - Adaptability to changing market conditions

3. What data sources and APIs offer the most reliable and comprehensive data for:
   - Stock market technical and fundamental analysis
   - Cryptocurrency market analysis
   - Historical and real-time data needs

4. What system architecture would best support:
   - Signal generation at daily/weekly frequency
   - Telegram notification integration
   - Scalability from small test portfolio to ~$500K

5. What risk management approaches are most effective for:
   - Portfolio sizes ranging from small test amounts to ~$500K
   - Combined stock and crypto exposure
   - Weekly/daily trading frequency

## Initial Hypotheses

1. A combined momentum and mean-reversion strategy might be effective for volatile markets, providing signals at a weekly frequency without requiring constant monitoring.

2. Python-based frameworks like PyAlgoTrade, Backtrader, or custom solutions built on pandas/numpy would likely provide the best balance of flexibility and implementation ease.

3. A modular system architecture with separate components for data acquisition, signal generation, backtesting, and notification would provide the most flexibility and maintainability.

4. Cryptocurrency markets may require different technical indicators than stock markets due to different volatility profiles and 24/7 trading.

5. Telegram Bot API would offer straightforward integration for sending alerts with detailed signal information.

6. Position sizing and risk management will be as critical as signal generation for managing a $500K portfolio, particularly in volatile markets.
