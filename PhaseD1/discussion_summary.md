# Discussion Summary (PhaseD1)

## Initial Understanding

The user wants to research how to build a quantitative trading system to help with trading during volatile market conditions. They have indicated they don't have prior experience in this area and need both research and eventually a proposal for implementation.

## Key Discussion Points

### User Experience & Background
- Experienced with programming
- Limited trading experience (mainly holding ETFs and blue chip assets)
- Some crypto trading experience with minimal returns

### Markets of Interest
- Stocks
- Cryptocurrencies

### Trading Timeframe
- Not interested in intraday trading
- Prefers daily/weekly frequency for signals
- Occasional signals (one to a few times per week) rather than constant trading

### Risk & Capital
- No specific risk tolerance constraints mentioned
- Plans to start with a smaller amount to test effectiveness
- Eventually may want to manage approximately $500K

### Success Criteria
- Detailed proposal for building the system
- Documentation of how the system would work
- Something that could be presented to a PM/engineering team for implementation
- User is open to different approaches (algorithm, strategic framework, etc.)

## User Requirements

- Signal-based system (buy/sell alerts) rather than fully automated trading
- Lower frequency trading (daily/weekly rather than intraday)
- Support for both stock and cryptocurrency markets
- Suitable for managing a portfolio eventually up to $500K
- Python preferred but open to other languages if better suited for quant systems
- Signal delivery via Telegram messages (or email as an alternative)
- Signals should include confidence levels and supporting data

## Priorities

- Creating a comprehensive proposal for implementation
- Understanding quant trading fundamentals and approaches
- Developing a system appropriate for someone with programming skills but limited trading experience

## Constraints

- User's limited trading experience
- Need for a system that doesn't require constant monitoring (not day trading)
- Near-term implementation timeline
- May need to identify appropriate data sources beyond the available financial API

## Context

- User wants to capitalize on market volatility using quantitative methods
- Goal is a proposal that could be handed off to developers for implementation
- User has programming background which could be leveraged for understanding technical aspects
